in the first screen shot: 
	DFS: 3 ms
	BFS: 2 ms
	UCS: 2 ms
in the second screen shot: 
	DFS: 5 ms
	BFS: 4 ms
	UCS: 3 ms
in the third screen shot: 
	DFS: 0 ms
	BFS: 1 ms
	UCS: 1 ms

we can see that when the path to the target had more obstacles (screenshot 1 and 2), the DFS was the slowest to reach the target, and the opposit when were less obstacles there (in the third screen shot).
However, in the whole experience Uniform Cost Search (UCS) is more efficient. It takes minimum time to reach the target with optimal path. Also, Breadth First Search (BFS) is optimal 
because it always expands the lightweight unexpanded node. the Depth First Search (DFS) is concidered to be the worst, because it takes more steps to reach the target. Hence the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) 
finds an optimal solution than other types of uninformed search algorithms.
